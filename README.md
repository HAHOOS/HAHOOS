# Hello there!
Hey there! I am a programmer nicknamed HAHOOS. I code in C#, Java and Luau. I made some projects which sadly did not gain any attention from anyone :(

My hobby is gaming and programming. I like military. I made projects like [DiscordAd](https://github.com/HAHOOS/DiscordAd), [CraftBlocker](https://github.com/HAHOOS/CraftBlocker), [WolfMaintenancePage](https://github.com/HAHOOS/WolfMaintenancePage) and [WolfLifesteal](https://github.com/HAHOOS/WolfLifeSteal).
